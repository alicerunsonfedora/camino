Camino is a slick, KISS theme for Jekyll. Camino originated from my own personal website and is now being open-sourced so that anyone can enjoy using this simple theme.

## I want it! So angry that I can't get it...

Then don't! Get this theme now by adding it to your config file:

```yml
remote_theme: alicerunsonfedora/camino
```
